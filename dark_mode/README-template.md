### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css : 3 position toggle light dark system
let root = document.documentElement;

root.addEventListener("mousemove", e => {
  root.style.setProperty('--mouse-x', e.clientX + "px");
  root.style.setProperty('--mouse-y', e.clientY + "px");
});

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```
