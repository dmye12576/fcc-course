          For a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put
          out my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time
          to say &quot;I'm going to sleep.&quot; Our five tags will be the
          flexbox items. They need to be nested in a flexbox container. So we'll
          surround them with a simple div, since the flexbox container serves no
          semantic purpose - it is only used to achieve a layout goal, and we'll
          apply a class to the div so we can easily apply the CSS we want.
        </aside>

          And half an hour later the thought that it was time to go to sleep
          would awaken me; I would try to put away the book which, I imagined,
          was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I had been thinking
          all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just been reading, but
          my thoughts had run into a channel of their own, until I myself seemed
          actually to have become the subject of my book: a church, a quartet,
          the rivalry between Fran√ßois I and Charles V.

            This impression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it
            did not disturb my mind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and
            prevented them from registering the fact that the candle was no
            longer burning.

            That is a great observation! The flexbox container will manage the
            header and footer height as a function of managing its vertical
            space. If you don't want the footer or header to be vertically
            resized, then the solution is to simply set their height. However,
            if you do this, you may notice that the flexbox container still
            gives their row extra height which they simply don't use. So the
            resulting layout is not optimal.
