              " His love of wrestling as a molder of young men are well known
              among those familiar with him. He has always handled his athletes
              with firm but fatherly discipline and always given a boy a push when
              a push is needed and a hug when that was called for. He is a fierce
              and fiery competitor and he does a remarkable job of instilling the
              same competitiveness in his wrestlers.""
